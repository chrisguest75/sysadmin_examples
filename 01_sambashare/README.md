# README
Demonstrates how to create a simple sambashare

NOTE: Easiest to use a Vagrant box. 

## Install and create samba share
```sh
sudo apt install samba
```

```sh
# find the installation directory
whereis samba

# view the config
cat /etc/samba/smb.conf   

# create a folder to share
mkdir -p /home/$(whoami)/sambashare
```

Add the following config to /etc/samba/smb.conf   
```ini
[sambashare]
	comment = Samba on ubuntu
	path = /home/[username]/sambashare
	read only = no
	browsable = yes
```

```sh
# reload the config
sudo service smbd restart

# list apss for the firewall
sudo ufw app list

# should show something like
> Available applications:
>  OpenSSH
>  Samba

# list info on what samba exemption does
sudo ufw app info Samba                             

> Profile: Samba
>  Title: LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix
> Description: The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that
> implements the SMB/CIFS protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve
> files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol is
> sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol.
>
> Ports:
>  137,138/udp
>  139,445/tcp

# we can allow the application
sudo ufw allow samba

# set a password for a non system account
sudo smbpasswd -a [a share username]

# get ip address   
ip addr
```

## Samba Client 
Connect to the share from another computer

Easiest is to use a GUI client and connect to 
```smb://[ip addr]/[name of share]```

### Install
```sh
sudo apt install smbclient
```

### Connect using shell
```sh
# list the shares
smbclient -L //[ip address] -U vagrant

# connect to the sambashare
smbclient //[ip address]/[sambashare] -U vagrant 
```

## Troubleshooting 

```sh
# list users
sudo pdbedit -L -v        

# who is connected to the shares right now
sudo smbstatus   
sudo smbstatus --help        

smbpasswd --help  
```
