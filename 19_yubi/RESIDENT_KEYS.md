# RESIDENT KEYS

Resident keys always stay on the security key.  The keys that are generated and stored locally are proxies to the private key. 

TODO:

* YubiKey resident SSH keys on Windows+WSL [here](https://zakaria.org/posts/resident-ssh-keys-on-windows.html)

NOTES:

* Requires brews OpenSSL as Apple compile with --disable-security-key
* Resident Keys are Passkeys
* Resident Keys are generated on the yubikey and therefore you will have a unique key per yubikey.  

## Generate

```sh
# OpenSSH_8.6p1, LibreSSL 3.3.6
ssh -V 

# openssh needs to be installed from brew
ssh-keygen --help  

export PATH=$(brew --prefix openssh)/bin:$PATH
ssh-keygen --help  

# clean out the key
ykman fido reset

# pins
ykman fido access change-pin --new-pin 654321

mkdir -p ./ssh_server/resident-keys

# no touch
ssh-keygen -f ./ssh_server/resident-keys/id_ed25519-sk-notouch -t ed25519-sk -O application=ssh:no-touch-personal -O no-touch-required -O resident

# list keys
ykman fido credentials list --pin 654321

# download keys from fido into current directory 
ssh-keygen -K
```

## SSH

```sh
# start the SSH server.  
docker compose -f ./docker-compose.ca.yubi.ssh.yaml up -d --build --force-recreate

# login
ssh -i ./id_ed25519_sk_rk_no-touch-personal -vvvv -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -p 2822 root@0.0.0.0
```

## Gitea

Goto Gitea [git-server/README.md](./git-server/README.md)  

```sh
# connect to gitea server
ssh -i ./id_ed25519_sk_rk_no-touch-personal -p 222 git@localhost
```

## Github

```sh
# override the ssh command to use the yubi resident key
export GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -i $(pwd)/ssh_server/resident-keys/id_ed25519_sk_rk_no-touch-personal" 
git remote show origin 
```

## Troubleshooting

It seems that if you're having trouble logging in then kill `ssh-agent` and try again.  

```sh
# 
ssh-add -D

ps -ax | grep ssh-agent
kill [id]
```
