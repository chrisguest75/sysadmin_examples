# IPV6

Some notes on working with IPv6.  

TODO:

* ndisc6
* Create a tcpdump of a ping
* Scopes
* WIFI and locating neighbors
* ipv6 routing?  
* no dhcp?  
* anycast?  
* Whois for ipv6 address  
* streaming in ipv6 - flow labels

## Notes

* Reasons to support IPv6 [here](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/01/29/reasons-for-servers-to-support-ipv6/)  
* Test your ISP support for IPv6 [test-ipv6.com](https://test-ipv6.com/)
* SLAAC (Stateless Address Auto Configuration) vs DHCPv6
* DAD (Duplicate Address Detection)
* CGNAT (Carrier Grade NAT) is a NAT at ISP level. Dynamically assigns IPv4. Not good for hosting. [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT)
* There are some ISPs that have no IPV4. Comments on lack of IPv6 Github APIs [here](https://github.com/community/community/discussions/10539)

## Documentation

```sh
apropos ipv6
```

## Config

```sh
# hosts file has ipv4 and ipv6
cat /etc/hosts              

# show the interfaces
ip link show 

# show addresses on interface
ip addr show wlp3s0 

# procfs details
ls /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all 
```

## DNS (AAAA)

```sh
# google has an ipv6 endpoint
open https://ipv6.google.com/

# look for AAAA records
dig ipv6.google.com
dig www.google.com AAAA
```

## Addresses

```sh
# loopback 
ping6 "::1"
http://[::1]:80/

ping6 "::ffff:127.0.0.1"  

# ping all nodes 
ping6 ff02::1%<interface>
```

## Find local neighbours

IPv6 uses NDP (Neightbour Discovery Protocol) over ARP.  

```sh
# show ARP and NDP addresses on local network
ip neighbor

# on macosx
ndp -a 
```

## Scanning networks

How can we scan ipv6 networks?  On an ipv4 network it's easy just to use `nmap`.
